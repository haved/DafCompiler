* My OCaml Adventure
Before you design a programming language you should probably know several languages following different paradigms.
I'd never tried functional programming before, and seeing as the LLVM tutorial was avaliable in it,
OCaml seemed like a great place to start.

** The packages I installed
Keep in mind you don't need all these to build the compiler
*** Pacman on Manjaro (Arch Linux)
- ocaml
- llvm-ocaml
- opam
- ocaml-compiler-libs
- ocaml-findlib
*** Opam
=opam init=
=eval `opam config env`=
=opam install ocp-indent=

*** I use spacemacs which already has an ocaml layer, using ocp-indent and merlin
