* My OCaml Adventure
Before you design a programming language you should probably know several languages following different paradigms.
I'd never tried functional programming before, and seeing as the LLVM tutorial was avaliable in it,
OCaml seemed like a great place to start.

** The packages I installed
This was using pacman on Manjaro (Arch Linux)
- ocaml
- llvm-ocaml
- opam
- merlin
