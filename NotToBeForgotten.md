##These are things to not forget
There are certain features that might not be implemented in early versions of the language, 
that I still might want to add someday.
This file contains both possible features and small things that would be cool.

#### Small things that would be cool
* Have scopes with only one statement log a "Suggestion" for you to remove the scope.

#### Possible features down the line
* The **elselse** keyword. When a set of "if"-"else if"-"else" has one of the ifs be true, and the else is skipped, run the elselse after the else instead.
* Call **elselse** something cooler
* The **retry** keyword. Just like *continue;*, only that the iterator isn't iterated
