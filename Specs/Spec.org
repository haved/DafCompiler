#+TITLE: The Daf Specification File

* The daf Specification
This is a document detailing the syntax and semantic rules of the daf language.
Its purpose is letting me note everything I need to figure out before finishing the parser.
** Definitions
The daf language consists purely of definitions. 
Everything in a file at the top level is a definition in some form, and if they are prefixed by "pub", 
they are accessible to other files including it as a name definition.
*** Def
The def is the most common top-level definition, and simply defines an alias to an expression. This is the common way of defining procedures, as they too are expressions.

**** Compile-time parameters
** Expressions
