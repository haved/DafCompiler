Itn this document, a scope is the set of tokens between either '(' and ')', '{' and '}' or '[' and ']'
Skipping over scopes means you, upon advancing past '(', end up on the token after ')'
When anything fails during syntax parsing, it it your job to print the error
When a definition fails, it will skip (over scopes) until the next 'def', 'let', 'typedef' or 'import' / after the next semicolon
When a definition fails, it will escape the scopes it's in, but not advance other than that
When a type fails, it should 'clean up after itself', often meaning exiting function type definitions
