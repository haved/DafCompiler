* More general stuff:
** TODO Add /isize/ type
** DONE Error recovery in statements, where only some statements require semicolons
   CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 13:34]
I'd rather not have multiple errors in the console for one misplaced word, but it's low priority
As far as I can remember the error recovery for statements is simply a TODO
** DONE Find out why the expression parser loop forever when a strange token is found
   CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 13:36] I was right, it did lack that
*** It probably lacks error recovery, maybe even with a TODO
** TODO Indent stuff to one tab instead of two spaces
** TODO Handle TODO in all files
** TODO Use more enum classes and keep global scope nice
*** Done for Postfix operators
** DONE Update tokes (remove dumb, make uncrt, ctor, dtor etc.)
   CLOSED: [2017-02-08 Wed 09:09]
** DONE What happened to the function parameters??
   CLOSED: [2017-02-08 Wed 09:09]
** TODO Rethink internal type representation
The question is: Should we have TypeReference as a class, and then replace unique pointers to typedef references with non-owning pointers to what the typedefs actually reference?
*** What about expressions
** DONE Consider putting With in the definition and expression parsers
   CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 13:37] Considered and decided against. See WithParser.hpp and the implementation file. It's nice enough
*** DONE Have a special case for statements
	CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 13:38] Done through a class that contains a pointer to either a WithExpression or a WithDefinition, returned by a general parser
** TODO Use /override/ more for AST subclasses etc.
** DONE Use two pointers in EitherWith
   CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 13:55]
Instead of one void pointer and a bool isExpression, have a WithExpression pointer and a WithDefinition pointer, and then simply assert one of them is always null.
** TODO Search for string references and remove slow copies
*** DONE For instance the Let and Def definition constructors
	CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 18:00]
** TODO Make compiler errors lowercase and remove punctuation
** TODO Check if having a TypeReference object is really necessary
** DONE See if one couldn't make the Definition parser and Expression parser more similar
   CLOSED: [2017-02-08 Wed 15:45]
As in ordering of functions found in both. Purely for consistency's sake.
** TODO Check consistency between Expression and Statement parser
** DONE Fix Error recovery to avoid loops and stuff. Use it in the Statement and Scope parsers
   CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 17:59]
** DONE Maybe clean up the Statement parser, as 'with' somewhat duplicates expression code
   CLOSED: [2017-02-12 Sun 19:08]
** TODO Add move - prefix operator
** TODO Add uncrt - prefix operator
** TODO Think more about ownership assignment
** DONE Add mut as possible prefix for function call arguments
   CLOSED: [2017-02-08 Wed 14:27]
** DONE Make the Statement parser more consistent by using null as error and none as semicolon
   CLOSED: [2017-02-12 Sun 22:36]
*** TODO Actually, remove the dual optional stuff by taking semicolon handling out of the statement parser
