#+TITLE: Compiler development TO DO

* TODO Parsing
** TODO Definitions
*** Let
**** DONE Let declaration be two separate tokens
	 CLOSED: [2017-03-26 Sun 14:30]
This could be done by always merging ':' and '='
EDIT: We solved it by just handling it
*** Def
**** DONE Add scope syntax
	 CLOSED: [2017-03-26 Sun 01:30]
**** DONE Use return type syntax from function types
	 CLOSED: [2017-03-26 Sun 14:30]
***** TODO Might as well add compile-time parameters while at it
*** DONE Typedef
	CLOSED: [2017-02-07 Tue 23:00]
*** DONE Namedef
	CLOSED: [2017-02-28 Tue 23:54]
Also requires Name-scope-expressions
**** TODO + operator for name scope expressions
*** DONE With
	CLOSED: [2017-02-07 Tue 16:53]
*** TODO Linkfile
** DONE Statements:
   CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 13:34]
*** If
*** For
*** While
*** Return
*** DONE Break
	CLOSED: [2017-02-07 Tue 16:53]
*** DONE Retry
	CLOSED: [2017-02-07 Tue 16:53]
*** DONE Continue
	CLOSED: [2017-02-07 Tue 16:53]
*** Definitions
*** Expressions
**** Scopes
** TODO All expressions
*** Number literals
*** String literals
*** Char literals
*** Variables
*** Functions
**** DONE Add all kinds of return type parsing
	 CLOSED: [2017-03-25 Sat 16:06]
*** Operators
**** Function calls
**** Array access
*** Scopes
**** DONE Complain when finalOutExpression is thrown strait to a void
	 CLOSED: [2017-04-01 Sat 23:18] Actually March 26 or something
**** DONE Require semicolon after scope if returns an expression, unless itself is returned
	 CLOSED: [2017-04-01 Sat 23:18] Actually ~March 26 here as well
Already implemented a long time ago, but make the warning better!
This will require a file id system for the TextRanges
**** DONE Scopes w/o finalOutExpression can't be finalOutExpressions
	 CLOSED: [2017-04-01 Sat 23:20] March 26 was not a good day for marking things as done, was it
*** DONE With
	CLOSED: [2017-02-07 Tue 18:33]
**** DONE With else
	 CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 12:41]
*** TODO Match
** TODO Types
*** Typedef reference
*** TODO Primitive types
**** TODO Numbers
**** TODO Pointers
**** TODO Arrays
*** TODO Class and trait definitions
*** TODO Merged types
* TODO Reference resolving
** TODO Restructure type reference system
** TODO Avoid recursion
* TODO Type inference
** TODO Type checks for operators
** TODO Type checks for calls
** TODO Using proper type in overloading
* TODO Method checks
** TODO Using proper values
*** TODO Mutability checks
** TODO Proper return values?
** TODO Uncertainty
* TODO Code gen

* TODO Language design
** TODO Should return types be direct, or is return by reference fine?
Could one potentially optimize it such that registers are used when beneficial?
** TODO Could you pass parameters by value with the same signature?
The compiler might just decide that a given function deserves registers instead of pointers,
but how would we then deal with already compiled functions?
* More general stuff
** TODO Add /isize/ type
** DONE Error recovery in statements, where only some statements require semicolons
   CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 13:34]
I'd rather not have multiple errors in the console for one misplaced word, but it's low priority
As far as I can remember the error recovery for statements is simply a TODO
** DONE Find out why the expression parser loop forever when a strange token is found
   CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 13:36] I was right, it did lack that
*** It probably lacks error recovery, maybe even with a TODO
** TODO Indent stuff to one tab instead of two spaces
** TODO Handle TODO in all files
** TODO Use more enum classes and keep global scope nice
*** Done for Postfix operators
** DONE Update tokes (remove dumb, make uncrt, ctor, dtor etc.)
   CLOSED: [2017-02-08 Wed 09:09]
** DONE What happened to the function parameters??
   CLOSED: [2017-02-08 Wed 09:09]
** TODO Rethink internal type representation
The question is: Should we have TypeReference as a class, and then replace unique pointers to typedef references with non-owning pointers to what the typedefs actually reference?
It's a lot better than a possible getType() being forwarded through a ton of TypedefType objects.
*** What about expressions
The same thing sort of applies to expressions. It's important to remember that in the case of expressions, there is a difference between using a variable and using a definition to a literal.
** DONE Consider putting With in the definition and expression parsers
   CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 13:37] Considered and decided against. See WithParser.hpp and the implementation file. It's nice enough
*** DONE Have a special case for statements
	CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 13:38] Done through a class that contains a pointer to either a WithExpression or a WithDefinition, returned by a general parser
** TODO Use /override/ more for AST subclasses etc.
** DONE Use two pointers in EitherWith
   CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 13:55]
Instead of one void pointer and a bool isExpression, have a WithExpression pointer and a WithDefinition pointer, and then simply assert one of them is always null.
** TODO Search for string references and remove slow copies
*** DONE For instance the Let and Def definition constructors
	CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 18:00]
** TODO Make compiler errors lowercase and remove punctuation
** TODO Check if having a TypeReference object is really necessary
** DONE See if one couldn't make the Definition parser and Expression parser more similar
   CLOSED: [2017-02-08 Wed 15:45]
As in ordering of functions found in both. Purely for consistency's sake.
** DONE Check consistency between Expression and Statement parser
   CLOSED: [2017-02-11 Sat 23:28]
** DONE Fix Error recovery to avoid loops and stuff. Use it in the Statement and Scope parsers
   CLOSED: [2017-02-10 Fri 17:59]
** DONE Maybe clean up the Statement parser, as 'with' somewhat duplicates expression code
   CLOSED: [2017-02-12 Sun 19:08]
** TODO Add move - prefix operator
** TODO Add uncrt - prefix operator
** TODO Think more about ownership assignment
** DONE Add mut as possible prefix for function call arguments
   CLOSED: [2017-02-08 Wed 14:27]
** DONE Make the Statement parser more consistent by using null as error and none as semicolon
   CLOSED: [2017-02-12 Sun 22:36]
*** DONE Actually, remove the dual optional stuff by taking semicolon handling out of the statement parser
	CLOSED: [2017-02-12 Sun 23:11]
** TODO Char literal syntax

** DONE Speed up lexer by reusing string objects
   CLOSED: [2017-03-26 Sun 14:39]
* Necessary(?) Feature creep
** TODO Flesh out 'own' syntax and semantics
For instance:
 - How does one signal who owns the value afterwards?
 - Can you combine own and move, what about giving ownership to a move?
 All this and more in ./dafScratchpad/OwnAndUncrt.daf
** TODO Flesh out 'uncrt' syntax and semantics
See OwnAndUncrt.daf for thoughts
** TODO 'move' syntax and semantics while we're at it
** TODO Syntax and semantics for function return type
As opposed to def return type. Should be a seamless transition between the two
** TODO Syntax and semantics for function and def parameters
E.g. What does move and uncrt or own mean for def parameters? What about def-def parameters?
** TODO How the void type is used for def
I'm thinking simply having it as any other type, 
with constructs complaining if you're returning an expression as a void value.

** TODO What even is the difference between def x(){} and def x:=(){}?
** TODO When can you access a class' private parts?
** TODO How do you remove the default destrcutor?
** TODO How to you make a quick data ctor,move,copy,assign_copy,assign_move?
** TODO What is the difference between returning from a function and a def?
*** TODO Returning by reference?
Should there be a difference between ():= and ():{} perhaps?
Maybe that is bad, though
* Testing
** TODO Check if some overridden classes lack virtual destructors
** TODO Assert Definition statements are not public definitions
