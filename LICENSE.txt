As of yet, I have yet to set a software license, as I'm not sure which to choose.

I'll allow people to do whatever they want to with my code, but I'd rather not have people selling it.
Selling code compiled with the compiler is of course OK. Because of this, I'm looking at some GNU licenses.
I'm not too sure about prohibiting the publishing changed binaries without publishing the code.
I feel like it's enough to prohibit sales.
A reason for not just setting some GPL is that I don't want people who copy my code to be restricted to the same license.
As long as they don't sell the code I'm fine.
I'd also like to have the opportunity to change the license for all the code later, even code written by me under the license.


Wanting a license where:

* I'm not liable for anything
* People can use the code for whatever
* People can't sell my code or modifications of it
* Use of my source must contain original copyright and the license
* Use of my code does not require you to publish source or follow the same license 
* I have the ability the change the license if I want to

Actually, I'm not to sure about the whole 'selling' point, and without it, the MIT License seems nice.
Message me if you want some explicit permissions for anything.
