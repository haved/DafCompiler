As of yet, I have yet to set a software license, as I'm not sure which to choose.

I want to allow people to do whatever they would like with my code, even modify or sell it, as long as I'm credited somewhere. I'm not doing it for the money, I'm doing it for the fame. Besides, I don't want to prohibit anyone from using my code. More likely than not, no one will ever use it, so I might as well be permissive.

Wanting a license where:

* I'm not liable for anything
* People can use the code for whatever
* People can use my code or modifications of it commercially
* Use of my source must contain original copyright and the license
* Use of my code does not require you to publish source or follow the same license 
* I have the ability the change the license if I want to

Message me if you want some explicit permissions for anything.
