* Def
A def is a function. Even if you say =def a:=5;=, it's still a function.
A function can have side effects, or take parameters.
A possible parameter can be another def, or a typedef or namedef.
This allows for meta-programming.

* Typedef
Give a name to a type, can also take parameters.
These parameters are different to the ones a def can take.
That's because a types are a compile-time concept.
