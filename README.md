## The Daf Compiler
A compiler for turning code in the daf langauge into c++

###### What is daf?
It's like java, only that you can put stuff on the stack. No garbage collection and compiled to machine code. 
Explicit mutability and built-in smart pointers (and dumb pointers!)  
What daf stands for, you ask? I dunno. **Definitely Adequately Functional**, perhaps?
