## The Daf Compiler
Daf is a staticly typed multi-paradigm programming language designed to make software writing easier. Without header files, and lots of oppertunities for kool meta-programming.

#### Repository structure
 - Compiler: The C++ project for the compiler, using LLVM and cmake
 - CompilerTests: A folder with a bunch of daf files you'll try to compile
 - DafLinker: The dafln python script for linking and parsing Linkfiles
 - DafParser: A java program for parsing old, simple daf, and turning it into C++
 - Compiler: 
 - Specs: contains markdown files for remembering stuff
Keep in mind that daf changes very quickly at this point, and that files may be outdated.
