####The Daf Compiler
A compiler for eventually turning daf code into machine code.

#######What is daf?
It's like java only with the ability of putting stuff on the stack. No garbage collection and compiled to machine code. Explicit mutability and built-in smart pointers (and dumb pointers!)  
  
What daf stands for, you ask? I dunno.
